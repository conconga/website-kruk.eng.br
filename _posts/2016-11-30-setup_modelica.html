Modelica was born as a high level programming language for modelling and
simulation, but shortly evolved to a standard. Nowadays one can find several
different implementations of the standard. Some of the most well known are
OpenModelica (free), JModelica (free), Dymola (Dassault Syst√®mes), SimulationX
(ESI ITI GmbH), MapleSim (Maplesoft), among others.  In addition, some of these
tools allow the user to export the result in accordance to the Functional
Mock-up Interface (FMI), another standard to permit models from different users
to be integrated easily in one unique big simulation somewhere in the world.

The goal of this post is not to talk about Modelica itself. One can find
abundant information in internet about it. Though, I intend to present my
simulation setup. It is worth noting that I am an open source evangelist.
Therefore, all that follows is build with free state-of-art software for
simulation. Enjoy!

<h3>basic setup:</h3>

I run a Debian machine, and I use OpenModelica. That said, the file
/etc/apt/sources.list was changed to:

<pre class="highlight">
# [ original from debootstrap ]
deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian jessie main
# [ kruk ]
deb http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main contrib
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main contrib
deb http://debian.sil.at/debian jessie main contrib
deb-src http://debian.sil.at/debian jessie main contrib
# [ modelica ]
deb http://build.openmodelica.org/apt  jessie stable
deb-src http://build.openmodelica.org/apt  jessie stable
</pre>

From a shell, the installation could not be easier:

<pre class="highlight">
# apt-get install openmodelica* ipython python-matplotlib
</pre>

Ok. That's all Folks! Yes and No. The installation is finished, but the
setup is just about to start. <br>

I do not like graphical interfaces. Although <i>OpenModelica</i> comes with the
nice <i>OMEdit</i>, I like more text files with comments. They are clearer for
me. I can read the equations faster when they are in one line, instead of being
spread in several canvas with long black tiny lines connecting them.

<br>In the following, I will implement a simple dynamic system (plant) as
well as a controller for it.

<h3>the plant:</h3>

<div class="about-legend">
    <img src="/images/20161130_post/setupmodelica_diagrama.svg" 
    width="100%" alt="dynamic system used" />
    [This picture was done using the tool 'potrace', from a scanned handwritten scratch converted to .svg file.]
</div>

Here we have a diagram of the plant. Very simple, it is just a mass moving
freely on a table (no friction) and subject to only one force. The system input
is the mentioned force, and the output is the position <i>x</i> of the mass.
The relation between input and output of the system is given by Newton's Law.

<h3>the problem:</h3>

The goal is to move the mass from position 0[m] to position 1000[m], and stop
there!

<h3>the Modelica object plant:</h3>

I put this code (file 
<b class="bold">plant.mo</b>) in a folder:

<pre class="highlight">
//(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)//
// # \author    Luciano Augusto Kruk
// # \web       www.kruk.eng.br
// # \date      2016.11.20
//(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)//

class PLANT
    input  Real force "[N]";
    output Real x     "[m] displacement";
    parameter Real mass = 1 "kg";
    Real v "velocity";

initial equation
    x = 0;
    v = 1;

equation
    v = der(x);
    mass * der(v) = force; /* Newton Law */

end PLANT;
//(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)//
</pre>

together with this one (file 
<b class="bold">doit.mos</b>):

<pre class="highlight">
loadFile("plant.mo");
getErrorString();
loadModel(Modelica);
getErrorString();
simulate(PLANT, stopTime=20, stepSize=1000e-6);
getErrorString();
</pre>

and, from a shell, I run:

<pre class="highlight">
$ omc +d=initialization doit.mos
</pre>

As the main output, OpenModelica creates a file called 
<b class="bold">PLANT_res.mat</b>, where all
public variables dependent on time are stored. If you got this file, everything 
seems promising, so far. But WTH is in the file, and how one can read it?

<h3>the *_res.mat:</h3>

Really, I will not be the one to explain you this file format. Sorry. I use a
self-made python script to extract the data from the *res.mat file. Wanna try?
Download momat2dat.py from <a href="/data/20161130_post/momat2dat.py">here</a>.
In a second you will have some examples on how to use the script.

<br>What about a hands-on the setup so far? Put the files 
<b class="bold">plant.mo</b>,
<b class="bold">doit.mos</b> and
<b class="bold">momat2dat.py</b> in the same folder, and type:

<pre class="highlight">
$ omc +d=initialization doit.mos
</pre>

If the file 
<b class="bold">PLANT_res.mat</b>
is available, run the code bellow to see a graph with the 
results (python-matplotlib required).

<pre class="highlight">
$ ipython
>>> import momat2dat          as lrf;
>>> import numpy              as np;
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot  as plt;
>>> lookfor = [ 'time', 'v', 'x' ];
>>> data = lrf.fn_open_mat('PLANT_res.mat', lookfor);
>>> 
>>> plt.figure(0); plt.clf();
>>> plt.plot(data[:,0], data[:,(1,2)], hold=False);
>>> plt.legend(('velocity', 'position'));
>>> plt.grid();
>>> plt.savefig('fig.svg');
>>> 
>>> plt.show(block=False);
</pre>

<h3>the garbage:</h3>

So far, I haven't found how one can do the steps above in a separated folder,
away from the .mo files. There is a set of useless (at least for me!) files
automatically generated in the folder. At least one good news: the filenames
are strange, but they do not change often, from one compilation to another.
That means one can make a script to clean the garbage and this script will not
demand continuous maintenance.

<br>
In my case, I have a script called 
<b class="bold">sh_build</b>
to call the omc command, and another called 
<b class="bold">sh_clean</b>, to rub the house.

<h3>some serious play:</h3>

What about some more action? I put here the basic structure of a PID
controller. When the plant is controllable in closed loop, the PID input shall
vanish. Its output contain the three known parcels, named proportional,
derivative and integrative.

<pre class="highlight">
//(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)//
// # \author    Luciano Augusto Kruk
// # \web       www.kruk.eng.br
// # \date      2016.11.20
//(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)//

class PID
	parameter Real Kp = 0;
	parameter Real Ki = 0;
	parameter Real Kd = 0;
	input Real u;
	output Real y;

	Real up;
	Real iu;
equation
	up = der(u);
	u = der(iu);

	y = (Kp*u) + (Kd*up) + (Ki*iu);
end PID;
//(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)//
</pre>
<div class="about-legend">
    [Content of file <b class="bold">pid.mo</b>.]
</div>

Now the final object which connects the PID model and the
plant together...

<pre class="highlight">
//(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)//
// # \author    Luciano Augusto Kruk
// # \web       www.kruk.eng.br
// # \date      2016.11.20
//(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)//

class main
    PLANT   p;
    PID     pid(Kp=1, Kd=1, Ki=0);
    //Real    force "[N] force";

initial equation
    //force = 10;

equation
    //when sample(0,10) then
    //    force = - pre(force);
    //end when;

    /* connection among models: */
    //p.force = force;
    pid.u   = - (p.x - 1000);   /* pid input */
    pid.y   = p.force;          /* pid output */
end main;
//(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)(=X=)//
</pre>

The file <b class="bold">doit.mos</b> shall be adjusted to 
deal with the new files...
<pre class="highlight">

Wanna see if it works? Me too!!
