This post still recovers some content presented in my last website.

I had a barely idea about _Digital Signal Processors_, and I wanted to
understand them better. How? I build my own SDK. I ate the datasheets up,
asked a lot of help to a friend in TI (hey, dear NP, I want to put your name
here! Can I?), and finally built this board, from schematics, including
layout, soldering and firmware, by myself.

The board has almost all I/O pins connected in a header, as in a development
kit. Since this C5502 has no flash, I put a MSP430 microcontroller to boot it,
when desirable.
