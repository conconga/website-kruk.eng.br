Here we have some pictures from the latest "developments".
</p>

<h3>a boat:</h3>
<p>
My son has designed and manufactured a boat made of
aluminium to keep it dry, and some rescue features in case
of any catastrophe...

<h3>a torax:</h3>
<p>
My daughter asked me how the air could go into the lungs. I
prepared this chest to clarify the answer...

<h3>a turntable roller:</h3>
<p>
My one disappeared. Truly. I am not just looking for an excuse to play with my printer... It
disappeared. And then I had to play with the printer...

</div>

<p>
The printed wheels were neither well centered, nor perfectly circular shaped. I designed a
very simple lathe to make the adjustments with a rotary tool.
