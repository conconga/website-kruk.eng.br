<h3>why to protect a LiPo against over-discharge?</h3>

<p>
A LiPo cell should never be discharged bellow a specified
value defined by the manufacturers. This value is normally in the range
of 3.0[V]/cell and 3.3[V]/cell. The Lipos are considered dangerous, and
might explode during the recharging cycle. When the charge is made with an
over-discharged battery, the explosion risk increases a lot. In some 
cases, the battery might be permanently damaged and the recharge is no longer 
an option.

Some projects use LiPo batteries in an unattended manner, i.e. running
for hours or days without constant check of the remaining battery level.
Therefore, one might be interested in a solution to cut the load off 
before the batteries are lost.

<h3>the <a href="http://www.linear.com/">LT</a> solution</h3>

<p>
The adopted circuit here was taken from an article written in
1999 by Albert Lee in Linear Technology Magazine:
"4.5uA Li-Ion Battery Protection Circuit".
</p>

<div class="about-legend">
    <img src="/images/20170214_post/circuito.svg" width="70%" alt="similar circuit to the apnote" />
</div>

<p>
The main explanation about the circuit is available in the document.
I present here a compendium of calculation to select the components for the circuit.
</p>

<h3>hysteresis</h3>

<p>
When the load is disconnected from the battery, it is expected that Vi
increases, and the Operational Amplifier (OpAmp) switches the load ON again.
With load, Vi falls down, and the OpAmp switches OFF, and so on.. This
switching endless cycle might destroy your load.
</p>

<p>
A nice feature of the circuit is the hysteresis created by the presence of R5.
When the battery (Vi) discharges, the commutation of the OpAmp from LOW (Load
ON) to HIGH (Load OFF) happens at Vi=Vi_low.  The resistor R5 shifts the
reference level up, and reduces the risk of the switching cycle. Vi should
reach Vi_high to have the load ON again.

<h3>basics</h3>

<p>
Note that the circuit (and the explanation in the article) compares two different voltages,
one created by the divider R3/R4, and the other by R1/Vd/R2/R5.
</p>

<p>
The voltage divider is really basic. Given an input voltage, the output 
is proportional to the input.
</p>

    <img src="/images/20170214_post/divisor.svg" width="47%" alt="classical resistor divisor" />
</div>

<p>
The sequence R1/Vd/R2 biased by R5 gives the other reference.  When the output
of the OpAmp is LOW, the circuit can be modelled by this equivalent, where Vt
is the difference between the LOW output of the OpAmp and ground:
</p>

    <img src="/images/20170214_post/load-ON.svg" width="47%" alt="load ON" />
</div>

<p>
When the output of the OpAmp is HIGH, the circuit might have this model, where VT is
the difference between the HIGH output of the OpAmp and Vi:

    <img src="/images/20170214_post/load-OFF.svg" width="47%" alt="load OFF" />
</div>

<h3>formula</h3>
<p>
The voltage reference vb1 is calculated by these equations:
</p>

<div class="about-legend">
    <img src="/images/20170214_post/vb1.svg" width="47%" alt="calculation of vb when load is ON" />
</div>

and vb2, by these:

</div>

<!-- _-=-__-=-__-=-__-=-__-=-__-=-__-=-__-=-__-=-__-=-__-=-__-=-__-=-_ -->
<h3>objective equations</h3>
<p>
Note that the values Vi_low, Vi_high, Vd, Vt and VT are project parameters.
The unknowns are R1, R2, R5 and k (voltage divider). I decided to select myself the
component R2, leaving three unknowns.
</p>

<p>
With this set of three equations, one can achieve all the unknowns, given R2:
</p>

<div class="about-legend">
    <img src="/images/20170214_post/sys2solve.svg" width="47%" alt="system of equations to solve" />
</div>

<p>
The value imin is the minimum current at the diode U2 to have a stable voltage
reference. If you use the component suggested by LT, the minimum current is only
20[uA]!! I use 30[uA].
</p>

<p>
This <a href="/data/20170214_post/py_lipo_protection">script</a>
(python) solves the problem for a wide range of R2 possibilities,
allowing the user to select easily commercial values for his own demands.

<h3>solution and test</h3>
<p>
In my case, a good starting point was a combination of R2=15[kOhm] and R5=2M2[Ohm]. All the 
values for the other components came nicely afterwards.
</p>

<p>
Here you have the first test with this approach:

and here the final implementation of the test setup.

I hope it helps you! Enjoy!
