So, this post intends to share a nice time I had some years ago. When living in
Brazil, I had a worm breeding at home. It was a set of three green bins full of
California worms. 
</p>

<p>
The bins stood one on the top of another, and a cover on the topmost.  The
upper bin collected (almost) all organic reject from my family. The composting
would start there, and the worms would participate. The middle bin was switched
with the uppermost when the latter was full. Therefore, there was free space to
collect more trash while the composting could continue in the middle bin.
Several holes at the bottom of the bins allowed free transit of worms in the
set.
</p>

<p>
One day, my kids (4-6) told their teachers about these worms they had at home
and could play with them, and that they ate all the trash we had, and that they
have had a lot of fun with these blind animals.... The teachers came to me and
invited us to talk about the breeding at home. Nice!
</p>

<p>
I took one bin full of worms to the school, and spend a whole morning talking
about these annelids. The kids could see, touch, play. For some of them, the
first impression of terrible, but they loved it after a while!  Sadly I cannot
say the same about the worms (some could not survive the kids!)..... See some
pictures:

Some days later, what a surprise. My talk was the theme of composition work at
school (see bellow). Nice, isn't it?
