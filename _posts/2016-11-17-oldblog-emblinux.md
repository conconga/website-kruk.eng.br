This post still recovers some content presented in my last website.

Before Raspberry, Panda, Beagle, and other vegetables or animals, there was
Linuxstamp board, from Paul Thomas. He made a nice job here: he managed to
build a computer with only two layers. The RAM chip is right at the 
opposite side of the processor. The board had PHY, USB and MMC/SD card. Simple,
but worked nicely for several purposes.

It has an AT91RM9200 microcontroller and runs Linux. Although it comes with its
own Linux, I decided to refill it with another kernel, rootfs, etc, just to
learn how to do it. Along some days I had the feeling of having made a s....,
but after some weeks, it came to life again.
