This post still recovers some content presented in my last website.

Everything I wanted to do with my hardware stuff needed to be collected in a
PC. When the parallel port (and serial afterwards) got almost extinguished from
computers, the way to communicate my sensors and boards with a PC was through a
USB channel.  But it was new, and any development kit expensive enough for a
student. 

Fortunately, FTDI had some cheap chips (FT245BM) doing the hard job, and Linux
and Windows had already a running driver for it. So, it should not be that had
to have my own USB development kit. Ok. I did again... Schematics, layout,
soldering, etc... And here you see the result: a very simple oscilloscope and
its application collecting some finger data:

Some years ago, a student sent me some emails asking things about the project.
I guess he wanted to build a similar one as his final work. Maybe I could help
him a bit...
